# PyGPTPrompt

PyGPTPrompt is a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline interactions with
advanced AI models. It specializes in managing context windows, optimizing both
short and long-term memory performance of models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
and those supported by the llama.cpp Python API.

Please note that the application is currently under active development. The
developer is working on separating concerns for handling the APIs and related
models, implementing context window management features, and restructuring the
core aspects of the library for better organization, efficiency, and
performance.

## Features

- **Context Window Management:** Enhances the short-term memory performance of
  AI models.
- **Data Ingestion:** Simplifies feeding data into AI models, enhancing their
  long-term memory performance.

## Roadmap

- **Context Management:** Restructuring the core APIs for congruency and
  alignment to simplify hot-swapping between models and improve context
  management.
- **Context Window Control:** Implementing IRC-like commands for handling the
  context window, such as freezing and unfreezing select messages within the
  queue.
- **GPT Function Execution:** Incorporating OpenAI's new Function API features
  for more reliable retrieval of structured data.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Implementing a vector database to enhance the
  model's memory capabilities.
- **Fine-Tuning LLama-2 Models:** Creating fine-tuned Llama-2 models for
  utilizing the Functions API and improving Mathematical and Programmatic
  reasoning for chat-like interactions.
